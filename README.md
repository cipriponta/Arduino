Robotec 2020 - Line Follower Classic
Line Follower Classic
These rules may not be the final ones, the organizers have the right to modify them as they see fit. If there are any changes we'll let you know at once.

 

THE GOAL OF THE CHALLENGE
The robot has to follow a black line on a white surface;
For the final ranking, only the best time of the 3 valid attempts will be taken into consideration.

REQUIREMENTS OF THE ROBOT
The robot has to be autonomous (no external control mechanisms are allowed after starting the robot, which can be done using a remote control) and must not be dangerous;
The robot may be altered between stages of the challenge during the competition as long as it is still compliant to the rules. All physical changes of the robot must be reported to the jury for approval. Alteration of the software does not need to be reported;
The jury has the right to inspect that the robot is compliant to the rules at any time;
The robot must not be leaking any substances or destroy the track in any way;
The robot can be equipped with an EDF (electric ducted fan) or suction device (or assimilated to), but it can NOT be used (activated) during the challenge;
The teams shall provide easily accessible and visible area of 2x2 cm designed for noninvasive marking of the robot with the purpose if internally identifying the robot during the event. Each competing robot shall undergo homologation (detailed below) and after successful homologation shall be identified.

THE ARENA
The arena has white surface and a black curve/polyline as a track.
Characteristics of the line course;
The width of the line is between 16 and 18 mm;
The lines of two adjacent curves should not be closer than 15 cm;
The minimum distance between the edge of the playing area and the edge of the line is 15 cm;
The curve radius is at least 7.5 cm;
There shall be no crossovers (e.g. places where the line crosses itself).

HOMOLOGATION
The robotâ€™s maximum dimensions are 30(Width)x30(Length) cm and the maximum weight is 3kg;
Visual inspection is performed for ruling out remote control systems.

THE COMPETITION
Timekeeping
Time shall be measured by an electronic gate system or by a judge with a stopwatch, based on the availability of the equipment. Either case, the recorded time shall be final. The final classification will be made using the best time for each robot.
Autonomous Control
Unless the judges allow it, any external interaction with the robot leads to a failed attempt.
The Course
After placing the robot behind the start line, it is activated upon the signal of the judge;
The time starts when some part of the robot crosses the start line the first time and stops when some part of the robot crosses the start line the second time after completing a full lap;
The robot must have contact with the surface at all times;
The robot has to follow the line at all times. A robot is considered to be following the line if any part of the robot overlaps the line. If the robot deviates from the line (no part of the robot overlaps the line), the attempt is considered failed.
Practice attempts
Will be held starting the day before the competition (after registration) and in the competition day until 1 hour before the challenge starts;
To test the robot, half of the arena will be available and the other half will be covered until the beginning of the challenge.
Calibration stage
It will be held in the day before the competition and in the competition day after check-in until the competition starts.
How the challenge takes place
Each robot has 3 attempts (one attempt per round), each attempt has maximum 3 minutes;
The robot must follow the line at all times. It is considered to have crossed the finishing line if any part of the robot crosses it;
Trespassing the marked area by the team members or objects connected to team members is forbidden;
Any manipulation of the robot (including by not limited to touching, poking, pushing, repositioning) is forbidden during an attempt of the challenge;
An attempt is valid if the robot is able to make 1 complete lap, starting from the start point set by the judge, and in the given direction (which is the same for all the robots), without leaving the line or having any external help (the actions of turning the robot on and off are, of course, allowed).
Cleaning
The arena is cleaned by the organizers at the end of each round or at the demand of the participants, between the attempts.
